		<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Zeng Guodong</span>. I make things on computer vision, machine learning and fond of travelling and photographying.</p>

		<p>
		Currently, I am working as a research associate on object detection for autonomous driving (including traffic sign, pedestrian and vehicle detection) in <a href="http://ste-ntulab.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx">ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laborator ( Singapore)</a>.</p>

		I earned a Masterâ€™s Degree in computer science from <a href="http://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University (BUAA)</a> in 2015 , where I focused my study on <span>computer vision and machine learning</span>, specifically named <span>person re-identification</span> (image retrieval).
