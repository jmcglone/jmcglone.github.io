# Words of wisdom...
I believe that how we play is largely informed by the state of our souls.

* Are we generally at peace with life? 
* Are we feeling in constant conflict?
* Are we in rebellion against.....virtually everything?
* Constantly wound up.....or taking life as it comes? 
* Think the above doesn't impact how you play? 

## Think again

### Want to know what's really going on inside of you? 
 Record yourself and listen......your soul will tell you instantly.
