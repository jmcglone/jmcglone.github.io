If you are here, I assume that we might have more than one thing in common ;) and probably have been waiting for this exceptional opportunity from the IFS. This article starts with a quick backgroung information on the foundation and details for this year's announcement follow. Do not forget to leave a comment at the end )^^ 
## IFS?
IFS which stands for International Foundation for Science was founded as a Research Council and registered as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Sweden in 1972. IFS receives funding from a portfolio of donors and funders including development organisations and science academies. The annual budget is approximately USD 5 million. IFS has 135 Affiliated Organisations in 86 countries, mainly in the developing world.
 
## They do what?
IFS provides opportunities for young scientists to propose research into biological and water resources in low income countries. These proposals are rigorously assessed by international experts, with grants and support provided to the very best early career scientists to enable them to work in their own country and tackle research issues related to local needs.
