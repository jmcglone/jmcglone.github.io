This is an test for my blog on github

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x\_1$, $y\_1$.

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

\\[ E(v,h \\theta) = \\sum\_i \\]

$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

$$ p(\mathbf{y})=\prod_{s=1}^{S}p(y_s|\mathbf{y}_{\pi(s)}) $$ 

$$ \begin{align} 
        A &= B \\\\ 
          &= C 
    \end{align} 
$$


$$ \begin{align} 
        p(x|\theta) &= \frac{\tilde{p}(x)}{Z(\theta)} \\\\\
              &= \frac{\sum\limits_{h} e^{-E(v,h|\theta)}}{Z(\theta)} \\\\
              &= \frac{\sum\limits_{h} e^{-E(v,h|\theta)}}{\sum_{v}\sum_{h} e^{-E(v,h|\theta) }}
    \end{align} g
 $$

* simplicity
* good performance and reliability
* no databases
* hosting to be free or really cheap
* a custom domain
* the ability to work on my site from anywhere if needed
* to use open source tools supported by an active development community
* to get up and running quickly
* to have version control on my website, preferably Git
* to be able to share my code so others can easily re-use it
