This is an test for my blog on github

Let's test some inline math $x$, $y$, $x_1$, $y_1$.

Now a inline math with special character: $|\psi\rangle$, $x'$, $x^\*$.

Test a display math:
$$
   |\psi_1\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle
$$
Is it O.K.?

* simplicity
* good performance and reliability
* no databases
* hosting to be free or really cheap
* a custom domain
* the ability to work on my site from anywhere if needed
* to use open source tools supported by an active development community
* to get up and running quickly
* to have version control on my website, preferably Git
* to be able to share my code so others can easily re-use it
