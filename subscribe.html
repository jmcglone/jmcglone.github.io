<h3> NewsLetter </h3>
  
<p> If you wish, you can subscribe to my newsletter. I will send an email once every month (atmost) till new consideration 
and just when there is new (and critical) content on this site. That implies all things considered around four
messages each year since I need more time to keep up with updating content. </p>

<p> To subscribe, just send me an email to my private email address <a href="contact">(me (at) {this domain} (dot) be)</a> with your subscription request as subject line.
If you want to unsubscribe, just send me that as a request too. </p>

<p> Privacy statement: your email address will only be used for this newsletter. Your data will never be shared. 
I only keep a list of email addresses. Your name, the amount of mails sent, initial subscription date and more 
are not stored or shared only your email address is. The list is maintained in an encrypted file. There is no 
backend runnig to send these emails (this might change, depending on popularity). Changes will be communicated 
in advance on this page and through email.
</p>
